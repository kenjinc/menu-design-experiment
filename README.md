# menu-design-experiment
This repository was created to store and document all data files and coding assets relevant to our compositional menu design experiment. In it, we provide a data dictionary alongside detailed accounts of our data cleaning and data handling procedures. Anonymized responses from the recruitment and appointment surveys were directly imported into this repository and are housed inside the folder labeled `data`.
